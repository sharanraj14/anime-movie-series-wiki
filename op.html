            <h2>Luffy</h2>
            <p>Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.

             <p>   Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.</p>
                
             <p>   As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.</p>
                
              <p>  Luffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation,[40] the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of Beli3,000,000,000. Since the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy has also been heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy, as well as the next Sun God Nika.</p>
                
               <p> He is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime series.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>
         <P> Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.</P>  

         <P>Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who is referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.</P>

         <P>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beri 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."</P>

         <P>Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beri 1,111,000,000.</P>

            <h2>StrawHat Pirates</h2>
            <p>The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue. They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.</p>

            <p>The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and formerly Gol D. Roger. They are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship, which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.</p>

            <p>Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four Emperors.</p>
